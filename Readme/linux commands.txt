========================================================================================================
Procedure to mount remote windows partition (NAS share):

1) Make sure you have following information:
==> Windows username and password to access share name
==> Sharename (such as //server/share) or IP address
==> root level access on Linux

2) Login to Linux as a root user (or use su command)

3) Create the required mount point:
# mkdir -p /mnt/ntserver

4) Use the mount command as follows:
# mount -t cifs //ntserver/download -o username=vivek,password=myPassword /mnt/ntserver

Use following command if you are using Old version such as RHEL <=4 or Debian <= 3:
# mount -t smbfs -o username=vivek,password=D1W4x9sw //ntserver/download /mnt/ntserver

5) Access Windows 2003/2000/NT share using cd and ls command:
# cd /mnt/ntserver; ls -l

Where,

-t smbfs : File system type to be mount (outdated, use cifs)
-t cifs : File system type to be mount
-o : are options passed to mount command, in this example I had passed two options. First argument is password (vivek) and second argument is password to connect remote windows box
//ntserver/download : Windows 2000/NT share name
/mnt/ntserver Linux mount point (to access share after mounting)
========================================================================================================

To get external ip address use wget -qO- ifconfig.me/ip



In this example copy /home/vivek/letters folder and all its files to /usb/backup directory:
cp -avr /home/vivek/letters /usb/backup


grep run-parts /etc/crontab (Tells when the chron jobs will run)


Find the passwd file under root and two levels down. (i.e root — level 1, and two sub-directories — level 2 and 3 )

# find / -maxdepth 3 -name passwd
./usr/bin/passwd
./etc/pam.d/passwd

 
Task: List all your cron jobs
Type the following command:
# crontab -l
# crontab -u username -l
for user in $(cut -f1 -d: /etc/passwd); do crontab -u $user -l; done
